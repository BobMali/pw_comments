Where comments are stored
-------------------------
Comments are stored at the pid of the page where they have been written. To see the comments just switch to list view
and click on the page.

Activate moderated comments
---------------------------
If a submitted comment is moderated and not yet visible, you have to activate it manually. To do this, switch to list
view and choose the page where the comment has been posted. Comments are displayed like that:

|comment_be_list|

You can click on the bulb to make the comment visible or click on the pencil to see/modify the comment's details.

Getting informed about new comments
-----------------------------------
pw_comments sends out an e-mail notification for each new comment. The default e-mail template contains a back end
link to the comment details. This requires a valid back end session.

Inform your users
-----------------
It is also possible to send mails to comment authors themselves when:
- a new comment has been written
- a moderated comment has been published
